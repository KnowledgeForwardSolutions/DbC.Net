As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a string value does not exceed a target maximum length. 

Requirements:

  RequiresMaxLength (precondition), default ArgumentException
  EnsuresMaxLength (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresMaxLength
2. Implement EnsuresMaxLength
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures MaxLength
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
6. Examples
