As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a string value starts with a target substring.

Requirements:

  RequiresStartsWith (precondition), default ArgumentException 
  EnsuresStartsWith (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying StringComparison value to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresStartsWith
2. Implement EnsuresStartsWith
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures StartsWith
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
6. Examples
