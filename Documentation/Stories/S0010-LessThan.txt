As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a value is less than a target value.

Requirements:

  RequiresLessThan (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresLessThan (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresLessThan
2. Implement EnsuresLessThan
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures LessThan
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
6. Examples
