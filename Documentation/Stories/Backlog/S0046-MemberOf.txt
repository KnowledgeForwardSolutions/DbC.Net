As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a value is a member of a target collection.

Requirements:

  EnsuresMemberOf (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IEqualityComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresMemberOf
2. Implement EnsuresMemberOf
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures MemberOf
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
6. Examples
