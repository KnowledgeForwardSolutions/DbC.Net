As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a string value has at least a target minimum length. 

Requirements:

  RequiresMinLength (precondition), default ArgumentException
  EnsuresMinLength (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresMinLength
2. Implement EnsuresMinLength
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures MinLength
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
