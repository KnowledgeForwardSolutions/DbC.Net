As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a numeric value is greater than zero.

Requirements:

  RequiresGreaterThanZero (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresGreaterThanZero (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresGreaterThanZero
2. Implement EnsuresGreaterThanZero
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures GreaterThanZero
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
