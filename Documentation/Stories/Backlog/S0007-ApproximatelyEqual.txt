As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a floating point value is approximately equal to a target value.

See https://floating-point-gui.de/errors/comparison/ for more info.

Requirements:

  RequiresApproximatelyEqual (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresApproximatelyEqual (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying comparer object to perform the comparison
  Default comparer should check ABS(value - target) < tolerance

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresApproximatelyEqual
2. Implement EnsuresApproximatelyEqual
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures ApproximatelyEqual
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
