As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that every member of a collection passes individual requires/ensures checks. 

Requirements:

  RequiresAll (precondition), default ArgumentException 
  EnsuresAll (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Action<T> that implements individual requires/ensures checks.
  Implementation for IReadOnlyCollection<T>
  Implementation for ICollection<T>
  Implementation for List<T>
  Implementation for IList<T>
  Implementation for IReadOnlyList<T>
  Implementation for array
  Implementation for HashSet<T>
  Implementation for ISet<T>
  Implementation for IReadOnlySet<T>

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresAll
2. Implement EnsuresAll
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures All
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
