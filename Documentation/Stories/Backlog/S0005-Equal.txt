As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a value is equal to a target value.

Requirements:

  RequiresEqual (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresEqual (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying an IEqualityComparer<T> to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresEqual
2. Implement EnsuresEqual
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures Equal
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
