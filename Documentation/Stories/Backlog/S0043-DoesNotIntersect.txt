As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a collection does not contain any items in common with a target collection.

Requirements:

  RequiresDoesNotIntersect (precondition), default ArgumentException 
  EnsuresDoesNotIntersect (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Implementation for IReadOnlyCollection<T>
  Implementation for ICollection<T>
  Implementation for List<T>
  Implementation for IList<T>
  Implementation for IReadOnlyList<T>
  Implementation for array
  Implementation for HashSet<T>
  Implementation for ISet<T>
  Implementation for IReadOnlySet<T>

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresDoesNotIntersect
2. Implement EnsuresDoesNotIntersect
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures DoesNotIntersect
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
