As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a value is not equal to a target value.

Requirements:

  RequiresNotEqual (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresNotEqual (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying an IEqualityComparer<T> to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresNotEqual
2. Implement EnsuresNotEqual
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures NotEqual
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
