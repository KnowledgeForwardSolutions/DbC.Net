As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a value is between a minimum and maximum value.

Requirements:

  RequiresBetween (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresBetween (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresBetween
2. Implement EnsuresBetween
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures Between
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
