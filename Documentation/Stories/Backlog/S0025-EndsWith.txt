As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a string value ends with a target substring.

Requirements:

  RequiresEndsWith (precondition), default ArgumentException 
  EnsuresEndsWith (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresEndsWith
2. Implement EnsuresEndsWith
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures EndsWith
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
6. Examples
