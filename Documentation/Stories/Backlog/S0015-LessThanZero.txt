As a developer who uses DbC.Net, I want to be able to require/ensure that a numeric value is less than zero.

Requirements:

  RequiresLessThanZero (precondition), default ArgumentOutOfRangeException
  EnsuresLessThanZero (postcondition), default PostconditionFailedException
  Support supplying IComparer<T> object to perform the comparison

DEFINITION OF DONE:

1. Implement RequiresLessThanZero
2. Implement EnsuresLessThanZero
3. Unit tests for Requires/Ensures LessThanZero
4. Performance tests
5. Readme updates
