# Introduction

DbC.Net is inspired by the concept of Design by Contract, first introduced by 
Bertrand Meyer in the Eiffel programming language and also by Microsoft's Code 
Contracts (no longer supported by .NET 5 or higher). DbC.Net lets you create
robust requirements based pre- and post-conditions with an expressive fluent
syntax.
